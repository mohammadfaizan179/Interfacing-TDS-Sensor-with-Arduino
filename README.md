# Interfacing-TDS-Sensor-with-Arduino
The TDS Sensor is interfaced with microcontroller Arduino  to get the TDS value of water to check its quality

--> TDS:

    TDS stands for total dissolved solids, and represents the total concentration of dissolved substances in water. 
    TDS is made up of inorganic salts, as well as a small amount of organic matter. Common inorganic salts that can be 
    found in water include calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium, which are all cations, and carbonates, nitrates, 
    bicarbonates, chlorides and sulfates, which are all anions. Cations are positively charged ions and anions are 
    negatively charged ions.

    TDS in general indicates how many milligrams of soluble solids are dissolved in one liter of water. It is measured in 
    parts per million or miligram per liter. In general, the higher the TDS value, the more soluble solids are dissolved in water, 
    and less clean the water is. Therefore, the TDS value can be used as one reference point for reflecting the cleanliness of the water.
